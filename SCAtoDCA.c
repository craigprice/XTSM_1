Function Description
------------------------
NDG 9/6/12, this routine is part of the timing system for the Gemelke lab rubidium experiment.
It converts a sparse timingstring into a dense control array for a single timing group (AKA output or input board).

Detailed description:
----------------------
This argumenmt takes two arguments:

first a pointer (returnarray) to the first element of a predefined 2D matrix of total size
(number of channels on board)x(number of updates in sequence) note that these parameters can be extracted from
the timingstring itself

second, a pointer (inputarray) to the first element of a 1D byte-array that is the timingstring.  the format is
described below by example:

A simple input timing string (should be passed in as second argument to function below) might look like the following:

54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,      //Total length of the timingstring in bytes  -  not yet used by dll
2,			//number of channels in group
	,			//number of bytes used to represent values
4,			//number of bytes used to represent repeat lengths
5,0,0,0,		//number of updates in this sequence
			//begin information for first channel
16,0,0,0,		//number of bytes in timingstring fragment for this channel
200,0,0,0,		//first value
3,0,0,0,		//number of times to repeat first value in this channel's output row 
125,0,0,0,		//second value
2,0,0,0,		//number of times to repeat second value in this channel's output row
			//begin information for second channel
16,0,0,0,		//same format as first (number of bytes in timingstring fragment for this channel)
200,0,0,0,		//first value
4,0,0,0,		//number of times to repeat first value in this channel's output row 
225,0,0,0,		//second value
1,0,0,0			//number of times to repeat second value in this channel's output row

the input string without comments is then:
54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,5,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,125,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,225,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

this c-code shuld be compiled (labwindows/CVI is sufficient) to produce a .dll to execute on the system hosting the output cards.  For the 
rubidium experiment in the Gemelke lab, this should be on the PXI system. The header file SCAtoDCA.h should accompany
this file in the Labwindows project.  

Any calling labview code should set 
	the first parameter as 'return type', type numeric, data-type 8-byte double
	the second parameter as 'returnarray', type Array, data-type Unsigned 32-bit Integer, Dimensions 2, Array format Array Data Pointer
	the third parameter as 'inputarray', type Array, data-type Unsigned 8-bit Integer, Dimensions 1, minimum size <none> Array format Array Data Pointer
the resulting function prototype should then read:  double add1(uint32_t *returnarray, uint8_t *inputarray);

Notes on recompiling:  to recompile, one must delete call library node references to this dll in all open or active (at least)
labview .vis and resave those .vis.  Otherwise, the compiler will complain it does not have access to the file it needs to create.

This routine was clocked at 1.5ms total time on a 10^5 element sequence (10^5 elements in the returnarray) representing 2 edges on a 32-channel dio sequence 10ms long
